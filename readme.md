# Project Title: Solidity Errors Contract

## Simple Overview of Use/Purpose:

This Solidity smart contract, named "errors," demonstrates error handling in Solidity by showcasing different error-related functions. The contract includes functions to double a number with a requirement check, check if a value is zero using an assertion, and double a state variable with a revert statement for invalid input.

## Description:

The "errors" smart contract is designed to showcase error handling techniques in Solidity. It includes three functions:
1. **twice(uint256 a):** This function doubles the input value `a` and includes a `require` statement to check if `a` is less than 10, throwing an error message if the condition is not met.

2. **zero(uint256 a):** This function checks if the input value `a` is equal to zero using an `assert` statement. It returns a string message indicating a match if the condition is true.

3. **twice2(uint256 a):** This function doubles the state variable `x` and uses a `revert` statement to handle cases where the input `a` is greater than 10. It demonstrates a different error-handling approach.

## Getting Started:

### Installing:

To use this smart contract, you can deploy it on a Ethereum-compatible blockchain. You may need a development environment like Remix or Truffle for deploying and testing.

### Executing Program:

1. Deploy the smart contract on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
2. Interact with the contract by calling the functions `twice`, `zero`, and `twice2` with appropriate parameters.
